 *	Assignment: Lab #1  Exercise #1 
 *	Exercise Description: Read an 8-bit value on PA7..PA0 and write that value on PB3..PB0PC7..PC4. That is to say,  
 *						  take the upper nibble of PINA and map it to the lower nibble of PORTB, likewise take the lower 
 *						  nibble of PINA and map it to the upper nibble of PORTC (PA7 -> PB3, PA6 -> PB2, … PA1 -> PC5, PA0 -> PC4).

 *	I acknowledge all content contained herein, excluding template or example
